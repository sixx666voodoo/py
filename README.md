# Sample Order Site

This repository contains a simple Flask application that demonstrates an order form with an order confirmation page.
When a user submits their email address, the app generates a random code and displays it as a confirmation.

## Running the site

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser and place a sample order.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```
